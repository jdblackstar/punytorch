# punytorch

punytorch is a simple and feature poor deep learning library implemented in Python. It is inspired by PyTorch, and is designed to be a simple and easy-to-understand implementation of a deep learning library (once it's working)

The goal is to have something very simple that will let me implement and experiment with new concepts quickly in my deep learning journey. I'm not trying to build a production-ready library, but rather a learning tool.
