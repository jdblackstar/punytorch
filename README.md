# punytorch

punytorch is a simple and feature poor deep learning library implemented in Python. It is inspired by PyTorch, and is designed to be a simple and easy-to-understand implementation of a deep learning library (once it's working)

The goal is to have something very simple that will let me implement and experiment with new concepts quickly in my deep learning journey. I'm not trying to build a production-ready library, but rather a learning tool.

# Example usage

1. If poetry is not installed, install it via: `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python -`

2.  Run `poetry install` to install the dependencies

3. Run `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment

4. Run `python examples/mnist.py` to train a simple model on the MNIST dataset

# FAQs
> can it run an LLM?

nope

> can it do classification jobs?

only 1, and barely

> what about computer vision?

punytorch is blind
